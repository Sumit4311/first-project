# first-project
A console-based Sudoku game in Java that generates a unique board on every run while following a consistent pattern of pre-filled and empty cells. Players can input moves, which are validated against Sudoku rules, with dynamic board updates. Simple, interactive, and a fun implementation of the classic puzzle!
